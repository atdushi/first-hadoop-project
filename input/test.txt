1,1,,2016-01-12T18:45:19.963,2,When I've printed an object I've had to choose between high resolution and quick prints.  What techniques or technologies can I use or deploy to speed up my high resolution prints? 
2,1,,2016-01-12T18:45:51.287,4,I would like to buy a 3D printer, but I'm concerned about the health risks that are associated with its operation. Some groups of scientists say it can be <a href="http://www.techworld.com/news/personal-tech/scientists-warn-of-3d-printing-health-effects-as-tech-hits-high-street-3460992/">harmful</a> for humans. What do I need to consider before buying a 3D printer if I care about my health? Are there any safe printers? 
3,1,,2016-01-12T18:46:22.083,3,I know the minimum layer height will effect how detailed of an item you can print and the amount of time it takes to print something, but is it necessary to have an extremely low minimum layer height if you plan to print only larger objects? 
4,1,,2016-01-12T18:50:55.973,4,Plastic is used in 3D FDM/FFF printing partly because it had a wide temperature range for its glass state - where it can be flowed with some force, but won't flow due only to gravity. Most metals have a very narrow, or non-existant, glass state.  They transition from solid to liquid with almost no flowable-but-not-liquid state. Are there any metals or alloys that display a glass transition state? 
5,1,,2016-01-12T18:53:53.623,5,What are the main differences when using ABS over PLA and vice versa? 
6,1,,2016-01-12T18:57:13.350,5,My MakerBot printer supports only two filaments at the same time. What are techniques to print objects with more than two colors for one object? 
7,5,,2016-01-12T18:57:48.103,,Filament is the plastic strands used as the print material for 3d printers. The most common types are PLA and ABS. There are also other types of filament that used other types of plastics as well as other materials.

9,2,2,2016-01-12T18:58:04.410,,Almost all 3D printers have issues that could cause health problems. FDM/FFF printers heat plastic to a temperature that may cause it to off-gas, and these byproducts may not be healthy. SLA printers often use epoxies that may off-gas, or may be somewhat toxic prior to being cured. Powder based printers can also off-gas, in addition to the powder itself presenting a possible hazard. Many hobbyist and small companies dance around the problem, and suggest that the machines always be used in well ventillated areas.  Professional machines often have filters and ventillation systems built in. Rather than trying to find a "perfectly safe" 3D printer, spend some time deciding what you want to use one for, find printers suitable for your use, and expect that you'll need to provide reasonable ventilation for almost any printer.  Plan your installation for that, and you should be able to make any printer safe for your required use. If, however, you plan on setting up a printer farm with many printers, and plan to have yourself or others spend significant time operating them, I suggest you work with a health and safety professional and have them identify possible hazards and plan mitigation. 
10,1,,2016-01-12T18:59:34.417,6,I'd like to print modifications for my bird feeder, both to patch over the hail damage from last summer and to try to deter the neighborhood squirrels.  I have an FDM printer (and experience with nylon, ABS, and PLA, though don't restrict answers to those if there's something else that's better), what kind of filament would stand up best to daily exposure to sun, rain, snow, etc? 
11,1,,2016-01-12T19:07:53.343,9,The surfaces of my printed parts using PLA plastic look rough and uneven. Would changing filament to a better one make any difference? If not, what kind of methods can I use to achieve a smoother finish for my for 3D-printed objects? 
12,2,2,2016-01-12T19:13:00.710,,There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) <a href="http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399">do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air</a>. Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086">this study</a> that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted. It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its "natural" origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since "natural" materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative. That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against "natural" materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades. <a href="http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html">Another study</a> is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins). There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective). Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a "safer" printers or using "safer" materials diminish. Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise. 
13,1,,2016-01-12T19:18:57.943,4,With an ABS or PLA extrusion 3D printer, are there any potentially negative quality differences that could occur if I try to print at a higher resolution? I am not concerned about print time as the equipment is not under high demand.  I am, however, worried the device may be more prone to fracture, likely to have defects, or have other issues I cannot currently imagine. 
14,1,,2016-01-12T19:22:14.277,7,I would like to print parts (e.g. jewellery) for use which I don't want to look or feel like a plastic, but metal-like, so briefly people won't see much difference. Are there any specific type of home-printers that can achieve that? Or it's rather kind of filament that you should use? 
15,2,2,2016-01-12T19:25:07.817,,Apart from the inherent process itself and direct health hazards from that, many 3D printers also require some complementary technology to work. <a href="/questions/tagged/fdm" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;fdm&#39;" rel="tag">fdm</a> printers have a printing head that needs to move around in 3D space. <strong>Moving machinery parts can be a hazard</strong>. In a home/hobbyist environment with children for example, I would recommend to buy a printer with a housing.  "open" designs often feature <strong>bare electronics</strong> mounted directly to the printer structure. This rises the possibility of short circuits and electric shock. The printers that heat material often do so at very high temperatures. <strong>Hot parts of the printer</strong> should not be touched. 
16,1,,2016-01-12T19:25:52.270,3,I am aware of several "clear" filaments for a ABS or PLA printer.  They, however, have a cloudy or frosted glass appearance. I do not believe this is possible to eliminate but I believe it can be reduced. Are there effective ways to make a print have a more transparent appearance? 
17,2,4,2016-01-12T19:27:20.113,,I"m no expert on this, but the article at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal</a> may be relevant for you. There are some special alloys, such as gold/silicon and various titanium-based ones, that become "bulk metal glasses" if cooled extremely quickly (for example, by sputtering onto a spinning cold surface). The speed of cooling prevents crystal formation. Early BMGs were quite strong but brittle; improvements have reduced brittleness and required cooling speed. 
18,2,10,2016-01-12T19:28:04.263,,PET(G) is a strong contender. It is very strong and water-resistant, and as such is often used to make pop bottles. PLA has a reputation for being "biodegradable" and therefore it is often discouraged to use PLA outside and/or in contact with water. However, PLA only biodegrades under very specific conditions which it won't generally be exposed to so it can be used (though, as a harder and less flexible material it is more likely to be damaged by hail). ABS and Nylon are good choices as well. Basically, any plastic you have on hand will last for years, even in an outside application. 
19,1,,2016-01-12T19:28:09.363,4,My printed parts consist rafts, supports and other extraneous filament when printing with ABS or PLA. What are efficient general techniques of removing them? 
20,1,,2016-01-12T19:30:45.060,2,I would like to understand the differences between rafts, skirts and brims. They appear in the software which I'm using to edit my 3D objects. Can anybody elaborate what are these and what are the main differences between them?
